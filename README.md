Set of applications intended to build on top of an existing [MusicBrainz database](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database) and provide features around album birthdays.

The idea is to have one or more applications that can fetch albums from a certain collection with their birthday within a certain period (e.g. today, this week, etc) and eventually provide ways of triggering their playback in the local collection or in some streaming service.
